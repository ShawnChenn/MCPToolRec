      "description": "The U460-003-3A1G Portable USB 3.1 Gen 1 Gigabit Ethernet Adapter's built-in USB-C cable connects to your tablet, laptop or computer to give you three external USB-A ports. Just plug and play with no drivers or external power supply needed. Ideal for a wide range of USB devices, such as flash drives, external hard drives, DVD players, MP3 players and digital cameras. Plus, the U460-003-3A1G's RJ45 port connects your computer to a wired network or the Internet using a UTP cable, such as Tripp Lite's N201-Series Cat6 cables, without requiring the installation of an internal Ethernet card. The bus-powered adapter and hub supports USB 3.1 Gen 1 data transfer rates up to 5 Gbps-ten times faster than USB 2.0-as well as true 10/100/1000 Mbps network speeds. All three USB ports support USB Battery Charging (BC) specification v1.2, which indicates they provide up to 1.5A for fast charging of mobile devices. The compact aluminum case fits easily into your backpack, briefcase or laptop bag to power USB-enabled devices or access the Ethernet wherever you are. The U460-003-3A1G is backward compatible with previous USB generations, so you can continue using older peripherals while getting maximum high-speed performance from new devices. Adapter is IEEE 802.3az (Energy Efficient Ethernet) compliant. Supports IPv4 and IPv6 pack COE (Checksum Offload Engine) to reduce CPU loading, as well as full- and half-duplex operations, Wake-on-LAN, jumbo frames and VLAN tagging."
